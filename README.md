## üöÄ Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repo
2. Right-click the `.ps1` script and **Run with PowerShell** (it will prompt for elevation if needed)
3. If it abruptly closes in the beginning I am most certain it is related to Policy Execution. This you can have set for this script specifically by running the batch file to execute it with a bypass.
4. Follow the interactive prompts, DO NOT close the windows pre-maturely otherwise it can corrupt the install and downloads.
5. Once the installer is complete, everything should be cleaned up and state where the logs are written.
