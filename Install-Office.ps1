.SYNOPSIS
Microsoft Office Auto Installer - Easy Office Installation for Everyone

.DESCRIPTION
This script provides a user-friendly interface for downloading and installing Microsoft Office
through official Microsoft channels. It handles execution policy issues automatically.

.NOTES
If you're getting execution policy errors, try one of these methods:

METHOD 1 - Bypass Execution Policy (Recommended):
Right-click PowerShell -> "Run as Administrator" -> Run this command:
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "Install-Office.ps1"

METHOD 2 - Copy & Paste Method:
1. Right-click PowerShell -> "Run as Administrator"
2. Copy this ENTIRE script content (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C)
3. Paste it into the PowerShell window (Right-click -> Paste)
4. Press Enter to run

METHOD 3 - Temporary Policy Change:
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser -Force
Then run: .\Install-Office.ps1

# ==== IMMEDIATE HARD PAUSE PROTECTION ====

# Set error handling to catch ALL errors immediately
